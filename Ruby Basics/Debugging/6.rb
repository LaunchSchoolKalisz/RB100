# You want to have a small script delivering motivational quotes, but with the following code you run into a very common error
# message: no implicit conversion of nil into String (TypeError). What is the problem and how can you fix it?

#The error is telling us that the method is returning nil, so we aren't returning thhe string that we want to

#one solution: explicit return 
def get_quote(person)
  if person == 'Yoda'
    return 'Do. Or do not. There is no try.'
  end

  if person == 'Confucius'
    return 'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.'
  end

  if person == 'Einstein'
    return 'Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.'
  end
end

#Another solution, refractor if statements
def get_quote(person)
  if person == 'Yoda'
    'Do. Or do not. There is no try.'
  elsif person == 'Confucius'
    'I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.'
  elsif person == 'Einstein'
    'Do not worry about your difficulties in Mathematics. I can assure you mine are still greater.'
